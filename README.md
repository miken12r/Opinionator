Uses AI to aggregate important news stories and assess their bias

**Our Vision**

"Opinionator" is a project to gain insight into the worlview that the internet espouses. The project's goal is to assess the temperature of information on the internet, not to establish objective truth about the world. This approach assumes all information on the internet is opinion only, so the only truth that can be emperically established is an assessment of how these opinions differ. We believe that real people can then form their own opinions based on a robust understanding of where information on the internet is rooted.

In short, this is an effort to understand how the internet thinks, less about how internet content came to be. It's the anti-spin solution.


**Value Proposition**

Opinionator enables people to form personal, yet community-aware opinions by easily comprehending what the "body-internet" espouses and where those opinions originate. People can then make critical decisions for themselves on the basis of such-well informed opinions.

Also, Opinionator shows you the underbelly of AI and the internet that controling powers don't want you to see; Opinionator turns their tech back on itself to reveal hidden secrets of influence.

Search Engines: 

A person wants to get updates on current events, such as the "war in Gaza" or the "2024 presidential election," so browses either a news site or enters keywords in a search engine. The results are curated and too vast to explore, so the person must form an opinion of the war in Gaza based on regionally curated and minimal information.

Perplexity:
AI search engine that summarizes stories without much critical analysis or historical journaling of how a story evolved. Broad coverage of stories similar to a search engine. Seems to be close to what Bing / CoPilot, Google, SearchGPT, and other search engines are already doing.

**Video 2: With Opinionator**

A person wants to get updates on current events, such as the "war in Gaza" or the "2024 presidential election," so opens Opinionator and clicks on the "War in Gaza" topic. The person then sees a dashboard of views on the war, dating back to its beginning on October 7, 2023. The person can interact with the charts to explore opinions of international media for any date range. The dashboard also make it clear how news outlets range in their treatment of the war. 

The person can also: 
 - Choose to follow for updates to the Gaza war as they occur
 - Dive into multi-modal content that supports a particular viewpoint
 - Provide an opionion to see where that opinion rates in contrast to internet Gestalt view
 - Maintain a personal diary of ideas and opinions
( - Ask for theories on what might happen next / in the near future)
 - Interact with communities of interest to establish an inter-personal understanding of events
